Summary: 

Cancer is one of the most common diseases worldwide and the number one leading cause of death according to the WHO. Of the various challenges associated with cancer treatment, one big hurdle lies in the very first step: diagnosis of cancer. Diagnosis is a difficult task that leaves much up to the observer. Not only does it take considerable resources for such professionals to be trained, but even then misdiagnosis is possible, especially with cancer in early stages. Hence, optimizing cancer diagnosis is the motivation for current research being done in the space of machine learning. In this project, we take a set of breast tumor image data and employ different machine learning methods to differentiate between malignant and benign samples. On the unsupervised end, focus on the task of clustering, having the computer divide the samples based on their properties, with the goal of getting a division that reflects the malignant/benign samples. On the supervised end, we use the included malignant and benign labels in the dataset to pre-categorize our data. We focus then on classification, training a model to predict whether a sample will be benign or malignant. Through this project we have thoroughly explored the usage and effectiveness of these various methods.
